Changes to shared land require consent from all owners. Disagreements must be resolved collaboratively or in court. Unauthorized changes are prohibited. 

P.S. *unauthorized changes shouldn't even happen, since to merge plots you need admins. If ADMINS do it without your consent, then file a case :)
